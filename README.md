   git clone <repository-url>
   cd steam-trade-farm
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

5. **Test configuration**
   ```bash
   npm run check
   ```

6. **Start the bot**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

Enter `env.example` and fill in your credentials:

```bash
# Account 1 Configuration
ACCOUNT1_USERNAME=your_steam_username_1
ACCOUNT1_PASSWORD=your_steam_password_1
ACCOUNT1_SHARED_SECRET=your_shared_secret_1=
ACCOUNT1_IDENTITY_SECRET=your_identity_secret_1=
ACCOUNT1_TRADELINK=https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=XXXXX&token=XXXXX

# Account 2 Configuration  
ACCOUNT2_USERNAME=your_steam_username_2
ACCOUNT2_PASSWORD=your_steam_password_2
ACCOUNT2_SHARED_SECRET=your_shared_secret_2=
ACCOUNT2_IDENTITY_SECRET=your_identity_secret_2=
ACCOUNT2_TRADELINK=https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=XXXXX&token=XXXXX

# Bot Settings
GAME_CODE=440
MAX_RETRIES=5
PORT=8080
```

### Obtaining Steam Credentials

#### 1. Shared Secret & Identity Secret
- Download [Steam Desktop Authenticator (SDA)](https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamDesktopAuthenticator)
- Login with your Steam account
- Extract `shared_secret` and `identity_secret` from the SDA configuration files

#### 2. Trade Links
- Go to Steam ‚Üí Inventory ‚Üí Trade Offers ‚Üí "Who can send me trade offers?"
- Copy the complete trade URL

#### 3. Game Codes (AppID)
| Game | AppID | 
|------|-------|
| Team Fortress 2 | 440 | 
| Unturned | 304930 | 
| Rust | 252490 | 
| DOTA 2 | 570 | 

## üìä How It Works

1. **Authentication**: Both accounts login using Mobile Authenticator codes
2. **Web Session**: Establishes trading sessions with Steam servers  
3. **Inventory Scan**: Locates tradeable items in configured game
4. **Trade Initiation**: Account 1 sends item to Account 2 with security code
5. **Trade Acceptance**: Account 2 validates security and accepts trade
6. **Continuous Loop**: Process repeats with items switching between accounts

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm start` | Start the trading bot |
| `npm run check` | Validate configuration |
| `npm run setup` | Create .env from template |
| `npm test` | Run the bot (alias for start) |

## üîí Security Features

- **Environment Variables**: Credentials never stored in code
- **Trade Validation**: Security codes prevent unauthorized trades
- **Mobile Confirmation**: Automatic mobile authenticator acceptance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and recovery
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays prevent Steam API abuse

## üåê Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
npm start
```

### Cloud Platforms
The bot includes a keep-alive server on port 8080 for platforms like:
- Heroku
- Railway
- Render
- Google Cloud Run

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Login Errors**
- Verify username/password are correct
- Ensure Mobile Authenticator is active on both accounts
- Wait 1 minute if Steam Guard errors appear

**Empty Inventory**
- Confirm you have tradeable items in the specified game
- Verify `GAME_CODE` matches your game's AppID
- Check that items are not trade-locked

**Confirmation Errors**
- Validate `identity_secret` is correct and current
- Ensure Mobile Authenticator hasn't been reset
- Regenerate secrets using SDA if needed

**Trade Failures**
- One account may have trade restrictions
- Check Steam privacy settings (inventory must be public)
- Verify both accounts are not trade-banned

### Debug Mode
Set environment variable for detailed logging:
```bash
DEBUG=steam-trade-farm npm start
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings

- **Use at your own risk** - Automated trading may violate Steam ToS
- **Test accounts recommended** - Don't use main/valuable accounts
- **Rate limiting** - Steam may temporarily restrict high-frequency trading
- **Account security** - Keep credentials secure and never share

## üìà Performance Optimization

- **Minimize inventory size** for faster item lookup
- **Monitor logs** for performance bottlenecks
- **Stable internet** connection recommended
